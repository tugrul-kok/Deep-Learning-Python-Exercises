    "One Hot Encoding is especially important for neural network tasks. Normally, for linear regression purposes it is common to represent categorical data by **integer encoding**, in which each integer starting from 0 or 1 represents a unique category on the specific feature. Though, this might be efficient for storage and maybe readability, modern neural network tasks are highly empowered with matrix representations and multiplications, and imposes a corelation between the categories. Therefore, for computational purposes, and eliminating the undesired hierarchy **One-Hot Encoding** is more preferrable where the observations with respect to a categorical feature are kept as a **sparse matrix** of zeroes and ones, ${1}$ representing the category of the observation."
